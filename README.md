This is the second version of the VFO with si 5351. I have added R-TX switching for radio transceivers. 
I used 7 segment displays, to give a vintage look!
I remind you that the project is experimental for hobbyists and homebrewing enthusiasts and can be changed without notice.
Any commercial use is strictly prohibited.
